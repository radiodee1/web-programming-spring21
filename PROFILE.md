I am interested in computer science.  I am taking one CS class at a time. I took my undergraduate classes at New Paltz also. I have some interest in artificial intelligence. I have used Pytorch and Tensorflow and even installed some simple Neural Networks on Raspberry Pi computers. I have finished a thesis project for my Graduate CS degree. I still have several more classes left to take for my degree.

From this class I hope to get some more advanced knowledge of how ‘full stack’ programs are written. I would also like to improve my web programming skills.
